      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>We visited Raitasante, a market area. We were instructed to talk with different vendors there 
        and try to understand them. We faced some issues. Most of the vendors were not interested in helping
        because they didn't see how they would benefit by helping us. Also there was a language barrier
        as only a few of us knew Kannada. We were told to collect as much info, pictures or drawings. 
        </p>
        <h2>Brief on work done</h2>
<p>We then showed our faculty all the work collected. He said that we have to make any content after the 
    end of the course. We could make printed books, pictures, stories or anything we wanted. He also 
    let us collect information from other people as well, because many of us had not collected much 
    information.
          </p>
          <h2>Final work</h2>
          <p>I used the information collected to make a case study of diverse people from across the world.
            Then i made a website wireframe. That will help you find what your skills are and which field 
            of study will suite you. Much like a personality test.
