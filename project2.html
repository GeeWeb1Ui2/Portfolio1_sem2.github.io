      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>We were told to think of a character from a movie that wants to solve a problem. We then had to think of a way to 
        solve his problem using a interface. I choose Nick Fury from Avengers. He wants to build a superhero team. 
        He wants get fast replies from heroes. 
        </p>
        <h2>Brief on interface design</h2>
<p>My website helps people build superhero teams. You can search through a list of popular superheros, all heros or post a job 
          and the applicants. If you want to know their powers you can see their list of powers and skills or watch a demo video which 
          demonstrates their powers. After you have made your choice you can then assemble the team and fight villains
          </p>
          <h2>Target Audience</h2>
          <p>This interface is generally aimed at superheros and/or people who want to build superhero teams. It is in place to assemble world 
            class alliances to defeat enemies. This is a public interface and anyone can log in and view the content available.</p>
