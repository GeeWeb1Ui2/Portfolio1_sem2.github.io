      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>We visited BLR Fort and had a team project. We had to collect information, pictures and 
        other content. We then had to make different contents from what we collected to be presented at 
        the college for exhibition. 
        </p>
        <h2>Brief on work done</h2>
<p>I was doing a documentation presentation for the first week. After the first few days i got bored 
    with that because it was too simple and i wasnt doing much work. So i started doing some illustrations.
When i showed the faculty she suggested doing 3 illustration of the fort from different views and 
naming it "Gates of BLR Fort- A Walkthrough". </p>
        <h2>Final work</h2>
        <p>I created a documentation presentation and 3 illustrations of the fort. 
            My friends created many other content like a short film, a 3d model, a painting, a comic book,
            illustrations, etc.
