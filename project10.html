      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>We were shown examples of interactive fiction games. In these games you can select different 
        choices. Based on the choices you take the stories that come up change.</p>
        <h2>Plot picked</h2>
        <p>I picked a short story by O. Henry called "The gift of the Magi". It is a Christmas story
            about a poor couple who want to buy each other Christmas gifts for each other. They end up
            selling their most prized possesions to buy each other gifts.</p>

        <h2>Story i made</h2>
        <p>In the original story there is much limited choices compared to the game that i made. I 
            created many different options that can be picked by the person.</p>
