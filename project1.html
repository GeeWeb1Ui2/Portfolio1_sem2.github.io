      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>We were told to look for a badly designed website. We had to create a website wireframe for the 
        existing website. We then had to think of ways to improve it and make changes to make it easier and 
        better.</p>
        <h2>Website picked</h2>
        <p>I picked a website called lingscar.com.
          It is car leasing and has a range of cheap cars for leasing and contract hire options for 
          business or personal use.
          This website is for people who want to rent a car for a short period from a month 
          to around 3 years. </p>
        
        <h2>Brief on problems with original website</h2>
        <p>The original website (LINGsCARS.com) had 
          too much animation, pictures. It was not a professional website for car leasing. 
          The home page was long and would take up lot of effort from the user to navigate up and down to the 
          navigation bar. 
          The cars list on the left side does not have to include the name of all the models that are available. 
          The website could just display the logo of all cars. If the user is interested in a particular car 
          brand he could click on the logo and it would take him to the list of the models of that car brand. 
          The car lease agreement need not be there at the bottom page. It can be displayed when you are 
          going to buy the car.</p>
        <h2>Brief on improvements done</h2>
<p>My website is better than the original website because it reduces the animation and pictures to a 
  minimum required amount. My home page is much smaller than the original and it is much easier for 
  the user to navigate by using the navigation bar. I reduced the car brands list to just their names. 
  If anyone is interested then they can click on the logo of the required brand and see all the 
  available models of that brand. There is an about 
  page if you want to know more about the owner. The car lease will be displayed on the page previous 
  to the final payment. <br>
  I completely changed the page from the original. I added a select city button at the top left of the 
  page where you can go and select the city. I also added a offers and deals bar at the top right 
  of the page. I also added 3 steps to get the lease offer. I removed a lot of unnecessary text, 
  pics, animation and the blank space.<br>
  
  This wireframe will satisfy the user more than the original one as you can get the lease offer 
  in 5 clicks<br>
  1. Select city<br>
  2. Select brand<br>
  3. Select model<br>
  4. Select loan/lease and fill in the details<br>
  5. Click get lease offer and fill in the details to get lease offers.<br>
  
  The changes i made will make it much easier and faster for users to get the lease offers. The 
  wireframe is also much easier to navigate than the original.
