      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>We visited KR Market. It is a market that sells a wide variety of items and goods.
        They are well known for their flower market, but they also sell house hold items, food items, 
        kitchen ware, daily items, etc. It is the first place is Bangalore to be lit with a light bulb.
        </p>

<h2>Brief on work done</h2>
<p>I had to talk to a vendor and collect information to make into any form: either digital or on paper.
 I spent a good amount of time to look for someone who speaks English. I finally found someone and 
collected a good amount of information from him. I decided to make a illustration of him infront of his shop.
I put that as the cover page. After that i put in a interview with the shopkeeper. </p>

<h2>Fictional vendor</h2>
<p>We also had to make up a fictional vendors life story and create some content on him.</p>

<h2>Final work</h2>
<p>I created a 16 page booklet. It included a short story that we had to make on a market on the 
first day in our class, a short history of KR Market, the interview with the shop keeper and the 
fictional vendor.</p>
