          <p>We had to each pick a website. As individuals we had to break down the layers of UX.

            <h2>Brief on work done</h2>
    <p>I picked YouTube as I use it on a daily basis and wanted to learn more on how it functions.
        I made a presentation explaining about the different layers of UX. The 5 layers of UX are
        Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton and Surface.         </p>
